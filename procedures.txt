In your taskbar, right-click on the start menu icon and select "Run" from the menulist (pic1). In the popup windows textbox, type in "%APPDATA%/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles" without the quotation marks and click "OK" (pic2). That will take you to pic3. If you have not set up any user profiles, you should see a folder with 8 numbers/letters with the extension ".default" (EX: ag6bk2dh.default) and that will be your user profile. Click on that folder (I selected firefox.FX0 because that is one of 3 user profiles I manually set up), as in pic4. That will expand the user profile folder tree and look for the "chrome" folder (pic5). If it doesn't exist, right-click on your user profile folder and select "New" > "Folder" (pic6). Click on "Folder" to create New Folder (pic7), remove the highlighted text and type in "chrome" without the quotation marks and click anywhere outside of the box to save. Insert the listTabs.zip file into the "chrome" folder (pic8). If using WinZip app, right-click on listTabs.zip file and select "WinZip" > "Extract to here" (pic9) and will extract the 2 files as seen in pic10. Right-click on listTabs.zip file and "Delete" (pic11), same with all the png images and the txt file. Open Firefox browser and open the Customize Toolbar Palette by right-clicking in an empty area in toolbar and select "Customize" (pic12). You will see the icon with the name List Tabs (pic13). Drag it onto a toolbar and should be good to go! Clicking on the button will bring up the filepicker for you to select where you want to save the file. Will create a numbered list of tab names. Entries are indented so all names are lined-up in a column.
